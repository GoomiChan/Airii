- Added an option to toggle the animation of the scanlines.
- Added optional map markers for each panels position.
- Added a logo to the options menu that will link to the forum post.

-==== V1.2 ====-
- Fixed the issues with the panels sometimes not opening. (for real this time)

-==== V1.1 ====-
- Added customization options, enable/disable scan-lines, shading and color editing.
- Adjusted the position of the panel at Hydro-Core.
- Added more panel positions at the printers.
- Added the option to disable the extra panels if you so wish.
- Added option to adjust the open range of the panels.
- Hopefully fixed the issue of the panels sometimes not opening/displaying. (hard to know for sure when I can't reproduce the bug >,>)
- Hopefully fixed the rare issue of multiple ships on the one line.
- Cleaned up some of the meshes that weren't quite right.
- Some small tidy ups.
